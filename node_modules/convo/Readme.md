# convo

  A tiny language for creating conversations. Useful for creating more natural bots and getting your computer to talk back to you.

## Usage

Turn this:

```js
/hi/i => q1: "What would you like to eat today?"
  /(?:i'd like an? )?(apple|pear|orange)/i => `Great! ${1}s are ${price}.`
    "no" => "Well, would you like anything else?"
      "no" => "Okay... is there anything else I can get you?" => q1
      /.*/ => q1
    /.*/ => "Thanks for your business! Would you like anything else?" => q1
  /I don't like eating/i => "Well, you're pleasant. You sure?" => q1
  /no/i => "Okay have a nice day!"
```

Into a conversation like this:

```
    me: Hi there!
seller: What would you like to eat today?
    me: I'd like an apple
seller: Great! apples are $0.80.
    me: Awesome, thanks!
seller: Thanks for your business! Would you like anything else?
    me: Actually, I don't like eating
seller: Well, you're pleasant. You sure?
    me: No
seller: Okay have a nice day!
